# Computational Biology - Python Portfolio
## Hello, welcome to my Python Portfolio I learned from BISC450C - Computational Biology during my Undergraduate at Louisiana Tech University.


Attached are my python codes that I have learned that consist of:
- Creating a Jupyter Notebook
- Python Fundamentals
- Analyzing Data with Numpy
- Storing Data Values in Lists
- Using Loops
- Using Multiple Files, with glob & matplotlib.pyplot
- Making Choices with if statements
- Creating and Using Functions
- Defensive Programming
- Transcribing DNA to RNA
- Translating RNA to Protein

In addition, are the files that I was working with. Follow along with my Portfolio for this class called Python_Portfolio_BISC450C
